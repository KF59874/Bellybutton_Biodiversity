## Overview

This project has been designed to complete a [website](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage") to visualize data from a belly button biodiversity research study. The study was conducted to analyze different bacteria found in belly buttons. Volunteer participants had their belly buttons swiped to gather data. 

## Results

### Website Visualization Tools
The website visualizes the biodiversity of the bacteria found in the participant's belly buttons. It showcases the data in various charts:

- Bar Chart: *Top 10 Bacteria Cultures Found*
